> **What's new in v1.18.0:** [Custom Widgets](#custom-widgets) — your own shell commands can now map their output to an icon/color per value range (`valueMap`), the same idea as the built-in rate-limit battery glyph. Renamed from "Custom Commands" (`customCommands`/`lumira custom` keep working as permanent aliases, nothing breaks) and gained a `description` field so a widget copy-pasted from someone else's config explains itself. Recent highlights: `⚡fast` badge for Claude Code's Opus fast-mode (v1.17.0); the [PR widget](#features) renders GitLab merge requests with the right `!N` prefix instead of GitHub's `#N` (v1.16.2); `refreshInterval` keeps idle-session data fresh (v1.16.0) — full [feature comparison](#how-lumira-compares) since v1.10. Still a **Claude Code plugin** — `/plugin marketplace add cativo23/lumira`, no npm required; run `/lumira:setup` to activate.

## Why lumira?

Claude Code's default statusline shows the model name and current directory. That's it. Lumira surfaces what actually changes during a session and what you'd want to react to:

- **Context-window pressure** — color-coded bar from green to blinking red, with a `/compact?` hint at high fill so you act before hitting the wall.
- **Burn rate** — `$/h` next to total cost, so a runaway agent shows up immediately.
- **Rate-limit battery** — 5h/7d usage shows as a Nerd Font battery glyph (or 🔋/🪫 in emoji mode) that fills as you consume quota, with a reset countdown above 70%. Hidden below 50% to keep the line uncluttered when you have margin.
- **Active tools, agents, and todo progress** — parsed from the live transcript, updated every render.
- **Cross-platform** — same config drives Claude Code and Qwen Code; Qwen sessions auto-collapse to single-line.

Inspired by [GSD's](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-core) statusline; takes its own stance on opt-in powerline rendering, theme contrast guarantees, and Qwen Code compatibility.

## How lumira compares

The Claude Code statusline space has several good tools. Here's an honest head-to-head on **features** against the other true statuslines (feature claims checked against each tool's current README, 2026-06-14):

| Tool | Runtime / deps | Distribution | Platforms | Config UX | Powerline + themes | Session-intel widgets |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **lumira** | TS / **0 runtime deps** | npm + npx + plugin (+ Qwen skill) | **Claude Code + Qwen Code** | Wizard + JSON + CLI flags | Yes (7 styles) + 7 themes, **WCAG-AA guard** | **Quota projection, pace delta, API-latency, auto-compact glyph + counter, cache, agents, MCP, todos, tools** + `stats` CLI |
| ccstatusline | TS / bundled | npm + npx | Claude Code | **Ink TUI** (live preview) | Yes + themes | Context, cost, usage %, block timer, compaction count, git; no quota/pace/latency |
| claude-hud | JS / Node 18+ | Plugin marketplace | Claude Code (v1.0.80+) | Guided `/configure` + JSON | No / no themes | Context, 5h/7d usage, cost, git, tools, agents, todos, cache TTL; no quota ETA/pace/latency |
| CCometixLine | Rust binary | npm + binary + source | Claude Code | TUI (TOML) | Yes + themes | Model, dir, git, context %, usage, cost, time, output-style |
| claude-pace | Bash + jq | curl + plugin + npx | Claude Code 2.1.80+ | JSON block | No / no | 5h+7d %, pace delta, reset countdown, git diff; ~10ms (lightest) |
| cship | Rust binary | binary / script / cargo | Claude Code | TOML (Starship-style) | Yes (Starship) + themes | Cost, context bar, usage limits, model, effort, agent, session, peak-time |
| starship-claude | Shell / needs Starship | Plugin + manual | Claude Code (no tmux) | Wizard + TOML | Via Starship + palettes | Context bar, model, session |

**Where lumira leads:** breadth of session-intelligence widgets — sole owner of an API-latency widget, a 7-day quota *projection ETA*, an MCP-server count, and a bundled `stats` analytics CLI, on top of the full pace / agents / todos / cache set. Plus zero runtime deps, dual-platform (Claude Code **and** Qwen Code), and WCAG-AA contrast enforced in CI on every theme. **Where it doesn't:** no Ink-style interactive widget builder — config is a wizard + JSON, not a live drag-and-drop TUI.

See [`docs/competitive-comparison.md`](docs/competitive-comparison.md) for the full per-widget matrix, config-UX detail, and distribution breakdown across every tool.

## Requirements

- **Node ≥18**
- **Nerd Font** (recommended) — for branch, folder, model, and spinner icons. **Use a recent build (Nerd Fonts v3.0+);** some indicators use newer Material Design Icons codepoints (e.g. the extended-thinking glyph `U+F09D1`) that older font releases render as a blank/tofu cell. Falls back to plain glyphs via `icons: emoji` or `icons: none`.
- **Truecolor terminal** (for themes / powerline) — auto-detected via `COLORTERM=truecolor`. 256-color terminals get a nearest-index projection; named-ANSI terminals fall back to default colors silently.

## Features

- **Context bar with thresholds** — green → yellow → orange → blinking red, plus an actionable `/compact?` hint when fill is high.
- **Session intelligence** — pace delta (🐢/🏎️) shows whether you're burning quota faster than the time window allows, with ETA when ahead of pace. Live agent count and cache hit rate round it out.
- **Powerline mode** + 7 separator presets (`arrow`, `flame`, `slant`, `round`, `diamond`, `compatible`, `plain`) across 3 lines.
- **OSC 8 hyperlinks** — clickable directory, repo, PR, and version tag on iTerm2, WezTerm, Kitty, VS Code, Alacritty.
- **7 hand-curated themes** — `dracula`, `nord`, `tokyo-night`, `catppuccin`, `monokai`, `gruvbox`, `solarized`. WCAG AA contrast guaranteed in CI.
- **Token + cost metrics** — input/output counts, speed (tok/s), $ total + burn rate ($/h), cache hit rate.
- **Auto-fits at <70 cols** — switches from 3-line custom mode to single-line minimal automatically.
- **Zero runtime dependencies** — Node 18+ only.
- **Dual-platform** — Claude Code and Qwen Code share the same config.

<details>
<summary>Everything else lumira shows</summary>

- **Git status** — branch + staged/modified/untracked counts, 5s TTL cache. Branch turns red on dirty repos in powerline mode.
- **Repo identity** — when Claude Code exposes `workspace.repo`, line1 shows `owner/name` as a segment linked (OSC 8) to the repo on its host. Toggle via `display.repo`.
- **PR widget** — open pull request/merge request for the current branch, with review state colored by tier (`approved`/`pending`/`changes_requested`) and an OSC 8 hyperlink to it. Shows `#N` for GitHub PRs, `!N` for GitLab MRs (including self-hosted instances) — the prefix is derived from the URL's path shape, not the hostname. Toggle via `display.pr`.
- **Rate limits** — 5h/7d usage as a battery glyph (Nerd Font level fill, or 🔋/🪫 in emoji mode) with color tier and reset countdown. Threshold-gated at 50% to stay invisible while you have margin.
- **Pace delta** — `usedPct − elapsedPct` of the 5h window. Turtle when behind pace (healthy), car with time-to-exhaustion when ahead. Color escalates green → yellow → orange → blinkRed. Toggle independently via `display.paceDelta`.
- **7d quota projection** — when the current burn rate would exhaust the 7d quota before the window resets, the 7d segment grows a warning: `⚠ ~24h`, `⚠ ~2d`, `⚠ Tue`, or `🔥 ~8h` (critical icon under 12h). Default on. Toggle via `display.quotaProjection`; off in the `minimal` preset. Different from pace delta — pace looks backwards at the 5h window's actual vs proportional burn, projection looks forwards at the 7d window's exhaustion ETA.
- **Active agents** — live count of running subagents (`⚡N agents`) plus types parsed from the transcript. Toggle via `display.agents`.
- **Subagent panel rows** — custom rendering for each row in Claude Code's agent panel via [`lumira subagent`](#subagent-rows): a state glyph (running / done / error / killed), the agent type and model as aligned columns, what each agent is doing, and its token count, in your configured theme and icon set. Opt-in at install.
- **Cache hit rate** — prompt cache efficiency for the current turn (`87%⚡`). Alarm-mode: hidden while ≥90% (Anthropic's prompt cache pins this near 99% in healthy steady state, so an always-on number is wallpaper, not signal). Surfaces as yellow/orange/blinkRed only when the cache is actually degrading. Same hide-when-healthy pattern as rate-limits and agent count.
- **Prompt cache badge** — warns before your prompt cache goes cold (`❄ 8m · 103k`), once it has (`❄ cold · 103k`), and right after a cache miss (`miss ×2 · 203k · model changed`). Hidden while the cache is healthy. See [Prompt cache badge](#prompt-cache-badge) for how to read it. Toggle: `display.promptCache`.
- **GSD integration** — current task and update notifications (opt-in).
- **Config health widget** — surfaces silent fallbacks (theme/powerline degrading in named-ANSI, missing GSD STATE.md). Opt-in.
- **Memory usage** — process RSS percentage.
- **MCP server detection** — count of attached MCP servers per session.
- **Fast mode badge** — shown when CC reports Opus running at 2.5x output speed (premium pricing). Renders as `fast` next to the same lightning glyph used for cache hit rate (nerd: `U+F140B`, emoji: `⚡`). Toggle: `display.fastMode`.
- **Vim-mode hint, thinking effort, worktree, output style, session name, added-dirs badge, worktree origin-branch breadcrumb** — all togglable per-field via `display.*`.
- **3-tier color system** — named ANSI / 256-color / truecolor, auto-detected.
- **Config-driven** — every feature toggleable via JSON config + CLI flags.

## Install

### Option 1 — Claude Code plugin (recommended)

No npm required. Works with the Claude Code plugin marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add cativo23/lumira
/lumira:setup
```

`/lumira:setup` finds the cached binary, writes `statusLine.command` to `~/.claude/settings.json`, and creates a default config. Restart Claude Code when done. To customize afterward: `/lumira:lumira`.

### Option 2 — npm

```bash
npx lumira install
```

The installer walks you through **preset** (`full` / `balanced` / `minimal`), **theme**, and **icons** — showing a live preview at each step. Press `Esc` to abort without writing anything. In non-interactive shells (piped stdin, CI), the installer skips the wizard and writes sensible defaults (`preset: balanced`, `icons: nerd`). If Qwen Code is detected (`~/.qwen/` exists), the `/lumira` skill is installed for both CLIs.

For the fastest statusline (the command runs on **every** render), the installer offers to install lumira globally so it can invoke the compiled binary directly (`lumira`, ~60ms) instead of `npx` (~10× slower). It also migrates older `npx lumira@latest` setups to the faster form automatically.

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g lumira
lumira install
```

To uninstall:

```bash
npx lumira uninstall
```

Uninstall only touches `statusLine` and `subagentStatusLine`, and only while they still point at lumira: if lumira replaced another statusline, that one comes back; everything else in `settings.json` — including edits you made after installing — stays as it is. If the backup lumira made at install time is corrupt, it is kept for you to recover by hand.

Your preferences are saved to `~/.config/lumira/config.json` — hand-edited keys (e.g. custom `display` toggles) are preserved on re-install. If `settings.json` or `config.json` isn't valid JSON (a trailing comma, a comment), the installer stops and tells you which file to fix instead of overwriting it.

### Manual setup

The `statusLine.command` runs on every render, so prefer the **direct binary**. Install globally (`npm install -g lumira`), then add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "lumira",
    "padding": 0
  }
}
```

If installed from source, point at the compiled entry:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "node /path/to/lumira/dist/index.js",
    "padding": 0
  }
}
```

> Without a global install you can use `"command": "npx lumira"` — it works, but resolves through npx on every render (~10× slower). Avoid `npx lumira@latest`: the `@latest` hits the npm registry on every render.

**Keeping idle sessions fresh (`refreshInterval`)** — Claude Code only re-renders the status line on session events, so time-based data (the clock, quota projection) goes stale while a session sits idle. Add CC's `refreshInterval` (seconds, minimum `1`) to `statusLine` in `settings.json` to also re-run on a fixed timer:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "lumira",
    "padding": 0,
    "refreshInterval": 5
  }
}
```

Set `refreshInterval` in lumira's own `~/.config/lumira/config.json` instead (see [Configuration](#configuration)) and re-run `lumira install` to have it transcribed into `settings.json` for you. It only applies to the main `statusLine` — `subagentStatusLine` isn't affected, since the agent panel already updates on token-stream events. Values below `1` (CC's documented minimum) round up to `1`, and non-integers truncate — a value that low means one process spawn per second for the session's lifetime, so prefer `5`+ unless you specifically need second-level freshness. **One-way transcription:** removing the key from `config.json` and re-running `lumira install` does NOT remove an already-transcribed `refreshInterval` from `settings.json` — the installer only ever preserves or overwrites, never deletes it. Unset it by editing `settings.json` directly.

**Clickable footer badges (`footerLinksRegexes`)** — a separate, native Claude Code feature (no lumira script involved): configure `footerLinksRegexes` in `settings.json` to turn IDs that appear in the conversation (ticket numbers, PR links, etc.) into clickable badges in CC's footer row, below the status line. See the [Claude Code settings docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#footer-link-badges).

## Display

### Custom Mode (default, >=70 columns)

![custom mode — 3 lines: model + git + dir + version, context bar + tokens + cost + time, tools + todos](assets/showcase/mode-custom.png)

### Minimal Mode (<70 columns or `--minimal`)

![minimal mode — single line: dir + branch + model + bar + tokens + cost](assets/showcase/mode-minimal.png)

### Powerline Mode (opt-in via `style: "powerline"`)

![powerline mode — same content with arrow separators and per-segment backgrounds](assets/showcase/mode-powerline.png)

Each segment renders with a distinct background color drawn from the active theme; segments are separated by a Nerd Font glyph (default ``). On dirty git repos the branch segment turns red. Falls back to classic mode silently in named-ANSI terminals (powerline needs RGB backgrounds). See [Powerline](#powerline) below for the 7 separator styles.

## Themes

Seven hand-curated themes, every one tested for WCAG AA contrast against white foreground in CI. Themes apply to both classic and powerline modes:

`dracula` · `nord` · `tokyo-night` · `catppuccin` · `monokai` · `gruvbox` · `solarized`

**Classic mode** — pipe-separated layout, theme colors applied to text:

![all 7 themes in classic mode](assets/showcase/themes-gallery-classic.png)

**Powerline mode** — colored segment backgrounds with arrow separators:

![all 7 themes in powerline mode](assets/showcase/themes-gallery-powerline.png)

Themes apply in truecolor and 256-color terminals; named-ANSI terminals fall back to default colors (8 base hues can't represent arbitrary palettes).

### Browse from the CLI

Try a theme without touching your config:

```bash
lumira themes                                # list all themes
lumira themes preview tokyo-night            # render a sample
lumira themes preview nord --powerline       # same in powerline (default arrow separator)
lumira themes preview gruvbox --style=flame  # powerline with flame separator
lumira themes preview --all                  # render every theme in sequence
lumira themes preview --all --powerline      # the powerline grid (great for screenshots)
```

### Want your favorite theme?

Adding a theme is a single new file plus a one-line registration. Every PR runs the **WCAG AA contrast guard** — if any powerline cell drops below 4.5:1 against the foreground, CI rejects it. See [CONTRIBUTING.md → Adding a theme](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-theme) for the walkthrough.

## Stats CLI

`lumira stats` reads a Claude Code or Qwen Code transcript `.jsonl` and prints a one-shot analytics summary — session duration, total cost, token totals, cache hit rate, tool call frequency, and burn rate (`$/h`). Useful for post-session review, scripting, and CI dashboards.

```bash
# Just works — auto-discovers the newest transcript for the current cwd.
lumira stats
# Session: 2h 15m — $4.23 — 156k tokens — 87% cache
# Tools: Bash×45 Read×32 Write×18 Edit×12 Agent×8
# Burn: $1.88/h
```

**Auto-discovery:** with no flags, `lumira stats` derives the Claude Code project slug from `cwd` (`/home/me/proj` → `-home-me-proj`) and reads the newest `.jsonl` under `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/`. If the current directory has no matching project dir, it falls back to the globally most-recently-modified transcript under `~/.claude/projects/` and prints a notice to stderr ("reading most recent session from …") so JSON pipelines on stdout stay clean.

**Flags:**

- `--session-id <path-or-uuid>` — override auto-discovery. A path (anything containing `/` or ending in `.jsonl`) is used as-is. A bare uuid is resolved first under `~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/<uuid>.jsonl`, then by scanning every project dir for that filename.
- `--no-color` — strip ANSI escapes (also honored when the `NO_COLOR` env var is set, per [no-color.org](https://no-color.org)).
- `--json` — emit the raw `SessionStats` object as pretty-printed JSON for `jq` / CI composability.

**Qwen Code sessions** are parsed the same way, but cost and burn-rate lines are suppressed when the transcript lacks usage blocks (`hasCostData: false` in the JSON output) — no misleading `$0.00`.

## Subagent rows

Claude Code (≥ 2.1.x) exposes a [`subagentStatusLine`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline#subagent-status-lines) hook that lets a command customize how each subagent renders in the agent panel — replacing the default `name · description · token count` row. `lumira subagent` reads the visible tasks from stdin and renders each row in your configured theme and icon set:

```
󱎫 Explore          haiku   reviewing auth module · 15k tok · running
✓ general-purpose  sonnet  exploring the codebase · 3k tok · done
```

Reading a row, left to right:

| Part | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Glyph | `󱎫` / `✓` / `⚠` / `—` | State: running (cyan), done (green), error (red), killed — stopped by you, not a failure (yellow) |
| Agent type | `Explore`, `general-purpose`, `code-reviewer` | Which kind of subagent it is — built-in or one of your custom agents. Claude Code's own row shows this too; lumira keeps it so replacing the row doesn't lose it. Names longer than 28 columns are cut |
| Model | `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus` | The model family the subagent runs on (dim). Claude Code's default row doesn't show it — handy when you mix models across agents |
| Description | `reviewing auth module` | What the agent was asked to do |
| Tokens · state | `15k tok · running` | Its running token count and state in words |

The type and model line up as columns across all visible rows, so parallel agents are easy to tell apart. Both need Claude Code ≥ 2.1.293: on older versions the columns are left out and rows look exactly as before, and a row that lacks one (say, a model Claude Code hasn't resolved yet) leaves that cell blank. Only `claude-…` model ids have a family to show. When rows don't fit, the descriptions are shortened first, then the model column is dropped, then the type column is narrowed — decided once for all rows so they stay aligned, and the state glyph and label always stay.

The **description** column falls back through `name → a meaningful type → description → id`: Claude Code reports every Task subagent with the generic `type: "local_agent"` and no `name`, so in practice it's the `description`. Rows respect your `icons` (`nerd`/`emoji`/`none`) and `colors.mode` config, and text from the payload is stripped of terminal control characters before it's drawn.

**Enable it:** the installer offers to register `subagentStatusLine` alongside the main statusline (opt-in — it never writes the second key without asking). To wire it manually, add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "subagentStatusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "lumira subagent", "padding": 0 }
}
```

It's robust by design: on any unreadable or malformed payload it emits nothing and exits 0, so Claude Code falls back to its default rows — a bad render never breaks the panel. Set `LUMIRA_DEBUG=1` to log the raw payload Claude Code sends to stderr.

## Prompt cache badge

Claude Code caches your conversation's prompt between requests. While the cache is warm, each message reads that context back cheaply; once it expires, the next message has to process and write the whole context again, which costs noticeably more. The cache lives for a fixed TTL (5 minutes or 1 hour — Claude Code reports which) and every message resets the clock — so it only goes cold when you step away.

Claude Code (≥ 2.1.251) reports the cache state to the statusline, and lumira turns it into a badge on line 2. It stays **hidden while the cache is healthy** and appears only when there's something to act on:

| State | When it appears | Example | What it means |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Expiring** (yellow) | Last 10 minutes of a 1h TTL, or the last minute of a 5m one | `❄ 8m · 103k` | The cache goes cold in 8 minutes. If it does, your next message re-caches 103k tokens. |
| **Cold** (cyan) | The TTL has passed with no new message | `❄ cold · 103k` | The cache is gone. Your next message pays to re-cache 103k tokens. |
| **Miss** (orange) | For 5 minutes after a cache miss | `miss ×2 · 203k · model changed` | A request just missed the cache. See below. |

`❄` stands for the Nerd Font snowflake; emoji mode shows 🧊 and `icons: "none"` shows `cache`. When more than one state applies, cold wins over expiring, and both win over a recent miss — they're the ones still worth acting on.

**Reading a miss.** The count and the token figure are **totals for the whole session**, not for the last miss alone. `miss ×6 · 680k · idle >1h` means this session has missed the cache six times and re-cached 680k tokens across all of them — roughly 113k each. Only the cause describes the **most recent** miss:

| Cause | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `idle >1h` / `idle >5m` | The TTL expired between messages |
| `model changed` | You switched models (e.g. `/model`) — each model has its own cache |
| `tools changed` | Tools were added or removed (e.g. an MCP server connected) |
| `prompt changed` | The system prompt changed |
| `server-side` | Most likely evicted on Anthropic's side; nothing you did |

Causes Claude Code adds later show up as-is, with underscores turned into spaces.

**What to do with it.** When you see expiring, sending any message within the window keeps the cache warm. When you see cold, decide whether the old context is still worth its re-cache cost: if it is, carry on — you pay once and the cache is warm again; if not, `/compact` or a fresh session re-caches far less. A climbing miss total is a hint that long sessions with frequent breaks are getting expensive.

**Countdown vs. clock time.** Claude Code only redraws the statusline when something happens, so a countdown would freeze while you're away. lumira shows the minute countdown only when it knows the line redraws at least once a minute — `refreshInterval` ≤ 60 in lumira's own config, applied with `lumira install` (see [Manual setup](#manual-setup)); a value set only in `settings.json` isn't visible to lumira. Otherwise the badge shows the clock time the cache expires (`❄ 14:26 · 103k`), which stays correct however long the line goes without a redraw.

The badge tracks the main session only — subagents keep their own caches and aren't counted — and appears after the first response of a session. Toggle with `display.promptCache` (on in `full` and `balanced`, off in `minimal`). It's independent of the cache hit rate widget (`87%⚡`), which measures the current turn; both can show after a miss.

## Powerline

`style: "powerline"` (or `--powerline`) renders the statusline with colored segment backgrounds and glyph separators inspired by powerline-go / oh-my-posh. Available separator presets via `powerline.style` (or `--powerline-style=<name>`):

| Style | Look |
|---|---|
| `arrow` | classic right-pointing triangle separator (default) |
| `flame` | wavy flame-shaped separator |
| `slant` | forward-slanting separator |
| `round` | rounded caps at line ends + thin internal separators |
| `diamond` | each segment isolated as its own pill with rounded caps |
| `compatible` | unicode `▶` separator (no Nerd Font required) |
| `plain` | no separator glyphs — just colored blocks |
| `auto` | picks `arrow` if Nerd Font icons are configured, else `compatible` |

### Hyperlinks (OSC 8)

The directory on line 1 becomes a clickable `file://` link, and the version tag links to its npm release page on terminals that support [OSC 8](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) (iTerm2, WezTerm, Kitty, Alacritty, VS Code terminal, tmux ≥3.4 with passthrough). Other terminals show plain text. Auto-disabled in `Apple_Terminal` (which leaks markers) and `TERM=dumb`.

```bash
NO_HYPERLINKS=1 claude    # disable
FORCE_HYPERLINK=1 claude  # force-enable (overrides denylist)
```

### Qwen Code

Lumira auto-detects the platform. In Qwen Code sessions, the renderer automatically switches to single-line output regardless of your configured layout — Qwen only displays the first statusline row, so lumira fits everything (model, branch, context bar, cost, cached tokens, thoughts) into one line. **No configuration needed:** the same `config.json` serves both Claude Code and Qwen Code.

## Configuration

Create `~/.config/lumira/config.json` — every field is optional, an empty file gets you the `balanced` preset defaults. Preset, theme, icons, style, layout, per-widget `display.*` toggles, context-bar thresholds, and every CLI flag are documented in **[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md)**.

### Debugging

Set `LUMIRA_DEBUG=1` to trace parser decisions on stderr — cache hits, GSD state-file resolution, MCP server loads. Useful when investigating "why doesn't X show up?" reports. Stdout stays clean so it doesn't corrupt the statusline.

```bash
LUMIRA_DEBUG=1 claude    # or export LUMIRA_DEBUG=1
```

## Custom Widgets

Render your own shell commands as statusline segments on any line — disabled by default, one command (`lumira widget enable`) turns it on. Output can map to an icon/color per value range (`valueMap`), same idea as the built-in rate-limit battery glyph. A widget is a single, self-contained JSON object — copy-paste-shareable, no import/registry needed. Full field reference, `valueMap` details, and ready-to-copy examples: **[docs/custom-widgets.md](docs/custom-widgets.md)**.

<sub>Was called "Custom Commands" (`customCommands`/`lumira custom`) — both names keep working as permanent aliases.</sub>

## Contributing

PRs welcome — particularly for new themes (one of the most common contribution paths). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the branching model, theme submission walkthrough, and the contrast-guard CI step that runs on every theme PR.

### What's next

- **Themes** — community theme contributions welcome via the theme PR template.
- **Backlog** — incremental transcript parsing for very large sessions (deferred; full re-parse stays under budget for real-world transcripts).

CLI flags, preset names, and the config schema have been stable since v1.0 — additive changes only.
